Go-Perun
========

`Go-Perun <https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/go-perun>`_ is an open-source library for building state channel applications on top of almost any transaction backend.
It is designed with modularity in mind.

Architecture
------------

**Abstract interfaces.** At the core of the library is the client package which represents the fundamental protocols. A client interacts with its environment through abstract interfaces.

* The transaction backend is represented by package wallet, which represents account logic and package channel, which provides the core data structures of a channel.
* The peer-to-peer communication layer is represented by package wire.
* Data persistence is provided through package channel/persistence.
* Logging is provided through the package log.

**Instantiation depending on the application context.** When building an application, the abstract interfaces are instantiated with concrete implementations depending on the application context.
By default, the library ships with an Ethereum adapter as the transaction backend, a TCP/IP adapter for client communication, a LevelDB adapter for data persistence, and a Logrus adapter for logging.


Tutorials
---------

Payment Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the :ref:`payment channel tutorial <payment_tutorial_intro>`, you will learn how to build a simple payment channel application that uses Perun channels for realizing fast and low-fee payment transactions.

App Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the :ref:`app channel tutorial <app_tutorial_intro>`, we guide you through the process of creating an app channel application where two players trustlessly play an interactive game with blockchain tokens at stake.

Virtual Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the :ref:`virtual channel tutorial <virtual_channel_tutorial_intro>`, describe how a two-party Perun virtual payment channel can be established.
Virtual channels are channels that are funded off-chain, from existing channels, and thereby they do not require any on-chain transactions to be created or settled.
