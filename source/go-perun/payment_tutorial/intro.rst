Introduction
=======================

In this tutorial, we want to take a look at the process of creating a simple application that allows two clients, Alice and Bob, to open a *go-perun* channel and use it for performing off-chain payment transactions.
We start by using Ethereum as the blockchain backend for funding channels and resolving disputes.

We will introduce the functionality that *go-perun* offers for this simple use case.
The presented implementation can be used as an example that helps you build your own channel application.
We also demonstrate the exchangeability of the underlying blockchain by switching our Ethereum payment channel :ref:`onto Polkadot <payment_client_on_polkadot>`.

Dependencies
-------------
Before we start, let us cover the dependencies required for following this tutorial.

Tutorial Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source code is available at `perun-examples/payment-channel <https://github.com/perun-network/perun-examples/tree/master/payment-channel>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Download repository.
   git clone https://github.com/perun-network/perun-examples.git
   cd perun-examples/payment-channel

.. attention::

    We use ``context.TODO()`` and ``panic(err)`` throughout the tutorial to keep the code simple. In production code, one should always initialize the context and handle errors properly.

Go
~~~

The tutorial source code will be written in `Go <https://golang.org>`_.
Basic knowledge of *Go* is therefore required.
The `official installation guide <https://golang.org/doc/install>`_ describes how to install the required command-line tools.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Check that Go is installed.
   go version

Ganache
~~~~~~~

We will use `ganache-cli <https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache>`_ as a local Ethereum blockchain for testing.
Please make sure that it is installed. You can find installation instructions on their `web page <https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Check that ganache-cli is installed.
   ganache-cli --version
